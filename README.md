# Library Management System (System Design Project)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **Library Management System (LMS)** developed **strictly for academic and system design purposes**.  
The project was created to apply and demonstrate **Software Engineering concepts**, **SDLC**, **Agile methodology**, and **UML/System Design diagrams** — **not** as a real-world or production-ready application.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> This system is a **conceptual and educational project only**.  
> It is **not intended for real-life deployment, commercial use, or production environments**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Apply **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** phases in a practical scenario  
- Follow **Agile methodology** with sprint-based development  
- Design and analyze system models and diagrams  
- Implement basic **CRUD operations** conceptually  
- Understand system architecture using **MVC pattern**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Academic Use)
- **Backend:** Laravel (PHP)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Frontend:** Blade Templates + Tailwind CSS
- **Architecture:** MVC (Model–View–Controller)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 👥 User Roles
- **Guest**
  - Register
  - Browse books
- **Member**
  - Login
  - Borrow & return books
  - View borrowing history
- **Admin**
  - Add, edit, delete books
  - Manage users
  - Monitor borrow records

---

## 📐 System Design Artifacts
This project includes detailed **system design documentation**, such as:

- ✅ Use Case Diagram  
- ✅ Activity Diagram  
- ✅ Class Diagram  
- ✅ Sequence Diagram  
- ✅ Context-Level DFD (Level 0)  
- ✅ DFD Level 1  
- ✅ ER Diagram  
- ✅ UI Mockups  

These diagrams are provided to **demonstrate design thinking and system modeling**, not production implementation.

---

## 🔄 Development Methodology
- **Agile + SDLC (Hybrid Approach)**
- Sprint-based development
- Incremental feature delivery
- Continuous review and refinement

### Example Sprints:
- Sprint 1: Project setup & authentication design  
- Sprint 2: Book management & borrowing logic  
- Sprint 3: Dashboard & UI mockups  
- Sprint 4: Testing & documentation  

---

## 🧪 Testing Approach
Testing was performed to validate **conceptual correctness**, not production reliability.

- Unit Testing (CRUD logic)
- Integration Testing (Controller–Model flow)
- UI Testing (Navigation & flow)
- Performance considerations (basic)

**Tools Used:** PHPUnit, Postman, Browser Console

---

## 🚫 Limitations
- No real-world security hardening
- No scalability or load testing
- No production deployment setup
- Simplified authentication & authorization
- Intended for **learning, evaluation, and demonstration only**

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with SDLC & Agile
- Practical understanding of system design diagrams
- MVC architecture comprehension
- Team collaboration using GitHub
- Translating theory into structured system design

---

## 📄 Documentation
Detailed system design, diagrams, and explanations are available in the **Project Report (PDF)** included in this repository.

---

## 📎 References
- Laravel Documentation  
- PHP Official Docs  
- MySQL Documentation  
- Tailwind CSS Documentation  

---

## 🧠 Final Note
This project was developed **purely for educational and system design practice** as part of a university course.  
If you’re reviewing this repository, focus on the **design decisions, diagrams, and methodology**, not production readiness.
