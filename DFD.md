# üìä Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
## Library Management System

---

## üìå System Overview

The **Library Management System** is a Laravel-based web application that enables:
- **Guests** to register, browse available books, and search library content
- **Members** to log in, borrow and return books, view their dashboard, and manage their profile
- **Admins** to log in, add/edit/delete books, view all members, and manage borrow records

---

## üîç Context Level DFD (Level 0)

The Context Level DFD shows the Library Management System as a single process interacting with three external entities: Guest, Member, and Admin.

## üìã Level 1 DFD (Expanded Process Details)

The Level 1 DFD breaks down the Library Management System into four main processes, showing detailed data flows between external entities, processes, and data stores.
